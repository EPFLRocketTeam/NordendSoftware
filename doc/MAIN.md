an ecosystem of programs which run on the 
EPFL Rocket Team 2021 Hostboard infrastructure.
It is mostly written in C/C++ and is made of two main programs and 
one operating system. <br>
The hardware on which this software runs is a custom SBC based around the STM32MP157
mixed microprocessor unit.  It is made of a dual core Cortex-A7 system and a singly core 
Cortex-M4 coprocessor.
